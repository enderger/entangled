# Entangled - An abstract puzzle game where you resize coloured blocks based on scale factors

# Future Ideas
As this game's development reaches it's end, here's some ideas for if and when I come back to this project to try to do it better:
- Scalable spikes
- Lock and key puzzles
- Grid based editor
- Better UI (automated factor display on blocks, main menu, etc)
- Proper use of level editor (possibly still YOLECK)
- Figure out WASM
- Communicate scale min, max, and direction
- Learn how to make decent levels
